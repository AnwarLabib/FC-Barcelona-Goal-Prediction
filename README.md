# FC Barcelona scoring goals prediction
Our research question is how many goals FC Barcelona is going to score in a certain match providing its date, opponent team, whether it is a home or an away match.

# Database used
Please download this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer and name it database.sqlite

# Data cleaning & analysis
In order to use the attributes mentioned above, we had to do some data cleaning and some data manipulation to reach the desired form of data we needed. Also some data analysis were done in order to know whether these attributes affect the number of goals that FC Barcelona score in a match. Visualizations were used such as multiple histograms and a table.

# Machine Leaning Algorithm
A simple linear regression model was used to predict the number of goals FC Barcelona will score. **sklearn** library was used in order to train and test the model.

# Jupyter Notebook
All the mentioned work is done in one Jupyter Notebook that is well organized named "barca_goals_prediction.ipynb"

# Powerpoint Presentation
A powerpoint presentation that briefly explains our project is in the repository and the it is named "Presentation.odp"
